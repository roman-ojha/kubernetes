*) Install and uninstall minikube with kubectl:
    -> Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell with administrative privileges.
        -> minikube stop
        -> minikube delete
    -> To uninstall Minikube, navigate to the folder where Minikube is installed (usually in C:\Users\<your_username>\.minikube) and delete the entire folder.
    -> To uninstall kubectl, open the Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
        -> kubectl config unset contexts.minikube
        -> kubectl config unset users.minikube
        -> kubectl config unset clusters.minikube
        -> kubectl config use-context <another_context> 
            -> Replace <another_context> with the name of another context if you have one.

    -> Install minikube will automatically install kubectl: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
    -> Run with 'hyperv':
        -> minikube start --driver=hyperv
        

*) If minikube stop working in windows 10 with hyperv:
    -> minikube config set driver hyperv
    -> minikube delete
    -> minikube start --vm-driver=Hyper-V

    *) Error:
        !‚ùØ minikube status
        W0831 09:18:41.735148   10484 main.go:291] Unable to resolve the current Docker CLI context "default": context "default": context not found: open     C:\Users\razzr\.docker\contexts\meta\37a8eec1ce19687d132fe29051dca629d164e2c4958ba141d5f4133a33f0688f\meta.json: The system cannot find the path specified.

    *) Solution:
            The error you're encountering is similar to the previous one and is related to Docker CLI context resolution in Minikube. It seems that Minikube is having trouble resolving the Docker CLI context named "default."
            
            Here are the steps you can take to potentially resolve this issue:
            
            Check Docker Contexts: First, check your Docker contexts to see if the "default" context is set. Open a terminal and run:
            
                docker context ls
            If you don't see a "default" context listed, you might need to set it or specify an existing context that you want Minikube to use.
            
            Set Default Docker Context (Optional): If you want to set the "default" context, you can do so using the following command:
            
                docker context use default
            Replace "default" with the name of the desired Docker context.
            
            Update Minikube Config: Since Minikube references the Docker context, you might need to update Minikube's configuration to point to the correct Docker context. Open a terminal and run:
            
                minikube config set driver docker
                minikube config set driver virtualbox
            This sets Minikube to use the "docker" driver and then switches it back to the "virtualbox" driver. You can adjust the driver based on your setup.
            
            Restart Minikube: After updating the Minikube configuration, restart Minikube:
                minikube stop
                minikube start
            This will stop and then start Minikube using the updated configuration.
            
            Check Docker Context in Minikube: Finally, run the following command to verify that Minikube is using the correct Docker context:
        
                minikube ssh "docker context ls"
            This should show you the active Docker context within the Minikube VM.
            
            By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue related to Docker context resolution in Minikube. If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your Docker and Minikube installations are up-to-date, and consider checking for any specific issues related to Docker and Minikube compatibility with your operating system.


*) Install Kubernetes in Ubuntu server VPS:
    here's a step-by-step guide to installing Kubernetes on your Ubuntu server:
    Update Package Lists:
    Start by updating the package lists on your server:
        sudo apt update

    Disable Swap:
        Kubernetes requires disabling swap. You can temporarily disable it with:
            sudo swapoff -a
        To make this change permanent, edit the /etc/fstab file and comment out the line containing the swap entry.

    Install Docker:
        If you haven't already, you can install Docker using the instructions I provided earlier.
        Install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl:

    Run the following commands to install the Kubernetes components:
        sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https curl
        curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
        echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
        sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

    Initialize the Cluster:
        On the master node, initialize the Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm. Run the following command:
            sudo kubeadm init
        Follow the instructions at the end of the output to set up your kubectl configuration for your user.

    Set Up Cluster for Your User:
        Run the following commands to set up your user's kubectl configuration:
            mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
            sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
            sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

    Deploy a Pod Network:
        You need a network add-on to allow communication between pods. A common choice is Calico:
            kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml

    Join Worker Nodes (Optional):
        If you have worker nodes, you can join them to the cluster using the command provided in the output of kubeadm init on the master node.

    Verify Cluster Status:
        You can check the status of your cluster using:
            kubectl get nodes
            
    *) Why not minikube:
        Installing Minikube is not necessary if you want to set up a full Kubernetes cluster on your Ubuntu server. Minikube is a tool that provides a lightweight Kubernetes environment for local development and testing. It's typically used when you want to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, isolated from your main development or production environment.

        If your goal is to create a production-like Kubernetes cluster on your Ubuntu server, you can follow the steps I provided earlier to install Kubernetes using kubeadm and set up the cluster with multiple nodes, if needed. This will give you a more realistic environment for testing and deploying applications in a Kubernetes context.

        On the other hand, if you're looking to quickly set up a small Kubernetes environment for local development, you might consider using Minikube on your local machine. However, keep in mind that Minikube is primarily intended for development purposes and might not provide the full features and scalability of a production Kubernetes cluster.
